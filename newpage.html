<h1>The cat and the mice</h1>

 <p2>Once a cat lived in a house. Some mice also lived in a hole near that house, The cat had seen the hole 
    and whenever it was hungry it would hide itself in the bushes near the hole. When any mice came out it
    caught them and ate them. Soon the number of mice began to decrease.
    They decied to tie around the cat's neck, so they might hear when the cat is coming. One day the cat
    was having a sleep, all the mice together tied the bell around the cat's neck. Now all the mice's 
    are safe, because whenever the cat was coming they would hear and quickly run to their hole. From that
    day on the number of mice increase.
    Moral of the story: </strong> Who will bell the cat??
